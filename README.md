# Vulpes Interactive Infographic Template

A starting point for websites and interactive dataviz. 

Check out a [demo/preview](http://ejfox.github.com/Vulpes-Boilerplate/).

The vision for this project was to create a template/boilerplate for creating interactive graphics using D3 and the LESS framework that would make it easy to move from concept to code without the hassle of setting up an environment with everything necessary. I even [made an Alfred plug-in to quickly clone this repo](http://ejfox.tumblr.com/post/35234790371) to decrease the time between idea and code. 

The libraries/frameworks currently included are:

* Less.css - <http://lesscss.org>
Including the useful mixin presets from [LESS elements](http://lesselements.com/) and RetinaJS. 

* LESS Framework 4 - <http://lessframework.com>
Modified to combine fluid and adaptive responsive techniques. Give projects smart defaults and a head-start on mobile devices.

* jQuery - <http://jquery.com>

* RetinaJS <http://retinajs.com/>
Simply include your retina assets with the same image name with ```@2x``` appended. For example, if you have ```folder_icon.png``` at 24x24px you'd make it's retina version ```folder_icon@2x.png``` at 48x48px. 

* Tabletop <https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop>
Starting code to [get data from a spreadsheet](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop#1-getting-your-data-out-there) into your JS code is included. 

* Underscore - <http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/>

* D3.js - <https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference>

* Lettering.js - <https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js>
For good-looking custom-made typographic headers and content.

* Scrollorama - <http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/>
For controlling attributes of different sections and navigation based on what part of the page you are in.
